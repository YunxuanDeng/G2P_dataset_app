# Animal-SNPAtlas: a comprehensive SNP database for multiple animals

This publication discusses: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as the most important type of genetic variation are widely used in describing population characteristics and play vital roles in animal genetics and breeding. Large amounts of population genetic variation resources and tools have been developed in human, which provided solid support for human genetic studies. However, compared with human, the development of animal genetic variation databases was relatively slow, which limits the genetic researches in these animals. To fill this gap, we systematically identified âˆ¼ 499 million high-quality SNPs from 4784 samples of 20 types of animals. On that basis, we annotated the functions of SNPs, constructed high-density reference panels and calculated genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrixes. We further developed Animal-SNPAtlas, a user-friendly database (http://gong_lab.hzau.edu.cn/Animal_SNPAtlas/) which includes high-quality SNP datasets and several support tools for multiple animals. In Animal-SNPAtlas, users can search the functional annotation of SNPs, perform online genotype imputation, explore and visualize LD information, browse variant information using the genome browser and download SNP datasets for each species. With the massive SNP datasets and useful tools, Animal-SNPAtlas will be an important fundamental resource for the animal genomics, genetics and breeding community.

It contains 5572 genotypes and 515000000 markers.
